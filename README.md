# Starship Looters

This project was made by **a team of four people** in **5 days** while attending **[the Wagon Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/fr "Check it out")**.

We wanted to **strengthen our Ruby on Rails** skills while _still having fun_ so we chose to go for a entertaining theme with **starship rental website** based on the concept provided by ***AirBnb***.

## We were able to implement several features of our model such as

- **A search bar** to help our users to ***find the starship of their dreams***.
- **A selection of available ships** in our homepage to _display a sample_ of what is available to **encourage users to sign up**.
- **A dedicated page** to ***help owners*** see all the ships they made available to other users.
- **A booking feature** which takes into account the **ship's availability and owner**. _( An owner can't book their own ships)_
- **A booking section** in which **users** and **owner** alike are able, *respectively*, to see ***their bookings statuses*** and ***to accept a renting request***.
- **A payment feature** which _uses a webhook_ to **update the related booking status**.

## **Our project** is available ***[here][Our Project]*** for you to see

You *may experience* ***some latency*** while _first accessing_ ourwebsite, this is **due to our hosting service** and is beyond our control, _please be patient_ while ***it crosses the void of space to reach you.***
